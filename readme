What It Does
=====

This profile outputs a number followed by the text 'days' (e.g. X days) to the '%Daysformatted' variable. The number that it outputs is the number of days since the date of the '%Fromdate' variable. As each day passes, the counter will increment by one. The '%Daysformatted' variable is then passed to Make Your Clock Widget Pro and can be used in user-created widgets. For information on how to use it in MYCW, please see: http://www.makeyourclock.com/tips-n-tricks-tasker.html

It may be useful for those who wish to keep track of how long it has been since they began or ended something (I'm sure you can think of a use).

Get Started
=====

After importing the Tasker profile, you'll have to manually create a variable named '%Fromdate' in the VARS tab. For its value, insert the date — in UNIX time — from which you want to begin counting.

That's pretty much it. Any questions, shoot me a message.
